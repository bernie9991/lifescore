## The Problem:

In our fast-paced world, rising rates of stress, anxiety, and sedentary lifestyles pose a significant threat to global health. UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 aims to "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages." A key part of this is encouraging daily habits that support both mental and physical health. However, staying motivated is often the biggest challenge.

## Our Solution: Making Well-being an RPG

LifeScore tackles this challenge by transforming personal development into a role-playing game (RPG). By completing real-life tasks—like meditating, exercising, or learning a new skill—users earn experience points (XP) and gold, level up their character, and see their virtual stats improve alongside their real-world well-being. This creates a powerful and positive feedback loop that fosters consistency and motivation.

## Core Features

*   **Gamified Tasks:** Add Habits, Dailies, and To-Dos to your quest log.
*   **Character Progression:** Gain XP and Gold for completing tasks. Watch your Health Points (HP) and Level increase as you build positive routines.
*   **RPG Stats:** Improve your character's Strength, Intelligence, Endurance, and Wisdom by sticking to your goals.
*   **Secure Authentication:** Easy and secure sign-in using Google or GitHub.
